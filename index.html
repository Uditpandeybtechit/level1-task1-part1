                <p id="second">The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) had undertaken two previous missions to
                    the moon,
                    namely,
                    the
                    Chandrayaan I and the Chandrayaan II. Chandrayaan-1 was launched in 2008 and lasted till 2009
                    after
                    communications to it were lost. The mission, among other things, tested a crash landing on the
                    lunar
                    surface. Chandrayaan-2, launched in 2019 attempted a soft landing on the moon but failed. The
                    third
                    mission,
                    Chandrayaan-3 took into account the drawbacks and lessons learnt from the second mission and
                    successfully
                    achieved soft landing.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Lander payloads:</b> Chandrayanâ€™s Surface Thermophysical Experiment (ChaSTE) to measure the
                    thermal
                    conductivity and temperature; Instrument for Lunar Seismic Activity (ILSA) for measuring the
                    seismicity around the landing site; Langmuir Probe (LP) to estimate the plasma density and its
                    variations. A passive Laser Retroreflector Array from NASA is accommodated for lunar laser
                    ranging
                    studies.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Rover payloads:</b> Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) and Laser Induced Breakdown
                    Spectroscope (LIBS) for deriving the elemental composition in the vicinity of landing site.
                    Chandrayaan-3 consists of an indigenous Lander module (LM), Propulsion module (PM) and a Rover
                    with
                    an
                    objective of developing and demonstrating new technologies required for Inter planetary
                    missions.
                    The
                    Lander will have the capability to soft land at a specified lunar site and deploy the Rover
                    which
                    will
                    carry out in-situ chemical analysis of the lunar surface during the course of its mobility. The
                    Lander
                    and the Rover have scientific payloads to carry out experiments on the lunar surface. The main
                    function
                    of PM is to carry the LM from launch vehicle injection till final lunar 100 km circular polar
                    orbit
                    and
                    separate the LM from PM. Apart from this, the Propulsion Module also has one scientific payload
                    as a
                    value addition which will be operated post separation of Lander Module. The launcher identified
                    for
                    Chandrayaan-3 is LVM3 M4 which will place the integrated module in an Elliptic Parking Orbit
                    (EPO)
                    of
                    size ~170 x 36500 km.
